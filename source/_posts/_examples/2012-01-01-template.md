of markdown and octopress syntax.

<!-- this is a HTML comment. It can span one line, or several,
     and will not appear in the browser when rendered as HTML -->

A special 'more' comment tag marks the end of content that should be previewed on
the blog index page, and where the 'Read More' link will be shown.

<!-- more -->


## This is a H2 heading

Posts automatically start with the title rendered as a H1 heading.  Therefore, your post
should only use subheadings of level 2 and greater.
